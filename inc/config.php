	 * Introduction to vichan's spam filter:
	 *
	 * In simple terms, whenever a posting form on a page is generated (which happens whenever a
	 * post is made), vichan will add a random amount of hidden, obscure fields to it to
	 * confuse bots and upset hackers. These fields and their respective obscure values are
	 * validated upon posting with a 160-bit "hash". That hash can only be used as many times
	 * as you specify; otherwise, flooding bots could just keep reusing the same hash.
	 * Once a new set of inputs (and the hash) are generated, old hashes for the same thread
	 * and board are set to expire. Because you have to reload the page to get the new set
	 * of inputs and hash, if they expire too quickly and more than one person is viewing the
	 * page at a given time, vichan would return false positives (depending on how long the
	 * user sits on the page before posting). If your imageboard is quite fast/popular, set
	 * $config['spam']['hidden_inputs_max_pass'] and $config['spam']['hidden_inputs_expire'] to
	 * something higher to avoid false positives.

	// Strategies for file generation. Also known as an "advanced build". If you don't have performance
	// issues, you can safely ignore that part, because it's hard to configure and won't even work on
	// your free webhosting.
	//
	// A strategy is a function, that given the PHP environment and ($fun, $array) variable pair, returns
	// an $action array or false.
	//
	// $fun - a controller function name, see inc/controller.php. This is named after functions, so that
	//        we can generate the files in daemon.
	//
	// $array - arguments to be passed
	//
	// $action - action to be taken. It's an array, and the first element of it is one of the following:
	//   * "immediate" - generate the page immediately
	//   * "defer" - defer page generation to a moment a worker daemon gets to build it (serving a stale
	//               page in the meantime). The remaining arguments are daemon-specific. Daemon isn't
	//               implemented yet :DDDD inb4 while(true) { generate(Queue::Get()) }; (which is probably it).
	//   * "build_on_load" - defer page generation to a moment, when the user actually accesses the page.
	//                       This is a smart_build behaviour. You shouldn't use this one too much, if you
	//                       use it for active boards, the server may choke due to a possible race condition.
	//                       See my blog post: https://engine.vichan.net/blog/res/2.html
	//
	// So, let's assume we want to build a thread 1324 on board /b/, because a new post appeared there.
	// We try the first strategy, giving it arguments: 'sb_thread', array('b', 1324). The strategy will
	// now return a value $action, denoting an action to do. If $action is false, we try another strategy.
	//
	// As I said, configuration isn't easy.
	//
	// 1. chmod 0777 directories: tmp/locks/ and tmp/queue/.
	// 2. serve 403 and 404 requests to go thru smart_build.php
	//    for nginx, this blog post contains config snippets: https://engine.vichan.net/blog/res/2.html
	// 3. disable indexes in your webserver
	// 4. launch any number of daemons (eg. twice your number of threads?) using the command:
	//    $ tools/worker.php
	//    You don't need to do that step if you are not going to use the "defer" option.
	// 5. enable smart_build_helper (see below)
