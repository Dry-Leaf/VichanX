Adding functionality to Vichan to reach feature-parity with Tohno-chan's prior KusabaX install, as well as further enhancements. 

To-Do:

* Post Editing
* Audio file playback
* When pressing the id on a post, and that id is inserted into the reply box, move user's scroll to the reply box with a url anchor
* Linking to posts that replied to a post(at least in the same thread) on the post
* Add board descriptions to the HTML title of thread pages
* Display entire text content of homepage recent posts in a tooltip, by inserting that data into the title attribute of those links
* Auto-update threads
* Allow users to select from which boards recent posts are visible on the front page.
