Adding functionality to Vichan to reach feature-parity with Tohno-chan's prior KusabaX install.

To-Do:

* Post Editing
* Audio file playback
* When pressing the id on a post, and that id is inserted into the reply box, move user's scroll to the reply box with a url anchor
* Linking to posts that replied to a post(at least in the same thread) on the post
* Add board link header to the catalog page
* Add board descriptions to the HTML title of thread pages
