Adding functionality to Vichan(final-pre-eol) to reach feature-parity with Tohno-chan's prior KusabaX install, as well as further enhancements.

To-Do:

* Post Editing
* Audio file playback
* When pressing the id on a post, and that id is inserted into the reply box, move user's scroll to the reply box with a url anchor
* Auto-update threads
* Allow users to select from which boards recent posts are visible on the front page.
* Kakusu (allows users to hide threads and posts)
